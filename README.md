# ECE-225A-Project-Brain-Stroke-Analysis-and-Prediction
This is the final project for ECE 225A at UCSD.

Data: 
- gender, age
- bmi, hypertension, heartdesease, avg_glucose_level, smoking_status
- ever_married, work_type, residence_type
- stroke (0 or 1)

Tasks:
1. Analyze and visualize the impact of each feature on stroke rate - Use bar charts, pie charts, histgrams, etc.
2. Significance test - Determine whether a specific feature has a significant relationship with stroke occurence.
3. Correlation map - Explore relationships between all features.
4. Train classification models and compare accuracy, recall, and f1-score
    - Naive Bayes (Bernoulli & Gaussian)
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbor
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Neural Network

Report: (two-columns)
